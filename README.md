# GCB-Diff
GCB-Diff: Global context-aware and boundary-aware feature fusion based on diffusion model for medical image segmentation

We propose an innovative three-dimensional (3D) diffusion-based medical image segmentation model called GCB-Diff, 
which significantly improves denoise and enhances global semantic interactions and edge features, resulting in superior segmentation accuracy.

GCB-Diff achieves more accuracy in multiple segmentation tasks compared with other 3D segmentation methods.

## Dataset 
We conducted empirical experiments on three publicly accessible datasets, ISLES'15, ISLES'18, and ISLES'22, 
to evaluate the proposed network and modules' performance and utility.


## Code
The paper is being submitted and the full code will be published soon.
